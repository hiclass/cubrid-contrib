# check-releases.sh - build against every current CUBRID release and report
#                     on-disk structure changes.
#
# Two things can break volmap when a release ships:
#
#   1. A header it includes changes shape.  The build catches that, so this
#      script builds the newest tag of every major.minor line from 10.2 on - the
#      10.1 tree lacks headers volmap includes (cubrid_getopt.h arrived in 10.2),
#      although 10.1 volumes are read and their structures compared below.
#   2. An on-disk structure changes in a file volmap cannot include
#      (disk_manager.c, file_manager.c/h, slotted_page.h are not standalone
#      headers, so src/storage_ondisk_layout.hpp holds a copy).  A build
#      cannot catch that - the copy still compiles and silently reads the
#      wrong offsets.  This script diffs those structures between releases
#      instead.  v11.4 inserting vol_creation into DISK_VOLUME_HEADER is the
#      case this exists for.
#
# The report has three parts, and only the second decides the exit status:
#   history       changes between consecutive releases - informational, since a
#                 change the copy already follows needs no action
#   current copy  storage_ondisk_layout.hpp against the newest release, any
#                 structure not found at all (renamed, or moved to a file this
#                 script does not fetch), and any supported release whose
#                 sources could not be fetched - these fail the check
#   develop       with --develop only - a warning, never a failure (structures
#                 and build alike)
#
# Usage:
#   sh tools/check-releases.sh              # structures + build (slow)
#   sh tools/check-releases.sh --structs    # structures only (fast, no compiler)
#   sh tools/check-releases.sh --builds     # builds only
#   sh tools/check-releases.sh --develop    # also compare against upstream develop
#
# --develop reports what the next release will bring, before it ships.  It is
# opt-in because develop moves: a change there is a warning, not a defect.
#
# Exit status: 0 clean, 1 a release build failed, 2 the copy needs updating (out
#              of date with the newest release, or a structure went missing),
#              3 both, 64 usage error.
#
# The work directory is removed on exit unless KEEP=1; a WORK given by the caller
# that already existed is left in place.  Logs of failed builds are kept in a
# separate directory, which the report names.
